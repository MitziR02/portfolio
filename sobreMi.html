        <p class="parrafo">
            Hello, I'm Mitzi Nayeli Osorio Rios. Passionate about web design and always curious about how things work. I am a firm believer in combining technical skills with a creative approach.
        </p>
        <p class="parrafo">
            I have a short but committed experience in front-end and in the use of technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I am specializing in React thanks to a scholarship from Oracle. I am constantly looking to broaden my horizons and keep up to date with the latest trends.
        </p>
        <p class="parrafo">
            Certified UX Designer thanks to a scholarship from Google, an achievement that has strengthened my ability to create user-centered interfaces. My experience ranges from high and low fidelity prototyping, to user research and usability testing.
        </p>
        <p class="parrafo">
            In addition, I have more than 2 years of experience in IT support, and to continue improving in this area, I am also pursuing a Google and Inroads scholarship in IT Support. In parallel, I have cultivated vector illustrations skills.
